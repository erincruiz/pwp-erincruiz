    <p><b>Purpose: </b> This project will be a professional portfolio website showcasing my photography and design work.</p>

        <h1>Persona</h1>
        <p><b>Name:</b> Andi James</p>
        <p>Andi is the owner of a new food truck that sells baked goods.</p>

        <p><b>Devices:</b> iPhone XR, it still works and it’s set up how she wants so she refuses to update to a newer model. Just purchased an ipad mini to use with Square to check out customers at the truck. Also has a chromebook at home to order ingredients, update Quickbooks and browse the web.</p>

        <p><b>Proficiency:</b> Uses Pinterest boards for ideas for her new business. Actively promoting her new business on Facebook to her friends and family. Doesn’t use her personal instagram or twitter too often because she would rather be in the kitchen baking up a batch of cookies. Has set up new social media pages for her new business but hasn’t posted yet. She also has everything connected through her Google account.</p>

        <p><b>Frustrations and Needs:</b> If it doesn’t involve icing, Andi doesn’t have an artistic bone in her body.
        Andi wants unique branding and doesn’t want to use the same logo templates that other bakeries use.
        She wants the branding and logo to be done and out of the way so she can update her social media pages, get the truck ready, and get to baking ASAP.
        Andi would like to see what the design looks like on things she needs like a menu or business cards before making a commitment to branding.</p>
       <p><b>Goals:</b>
        Andi wants to find someone who can help her design and logo and figure out branding so she can open her new food truck. She wants to find someone that has experience designing for other businesses and see the work that they have done for them. Andi wants to be able to contact the designer and ask questions before deciding who she wants to work with. Andi is also looking for a designer that will show her what her potential logo and branding will look like on her truck, packaging, and business cards.</p>
        <p><b>User-story:</b> "As a user, I want to see the projects that were previously done by this designer and contact them with any questions I might have."</p>
