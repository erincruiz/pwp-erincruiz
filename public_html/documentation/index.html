        <p>No," said Ron, "I shouldn't've -" "Forget it, "Harry said. Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back Hermione burst into tears. "There's nothing to cry about!" Harry told her, bewildered. "You two are so stupid!" she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling. "Barking mad," said Ron, shaking his head. "Harry, c'mon, they'll be putting up your scores. . . ." Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.

It took three more underwater renditions of the egg's song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him. "I've got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground. . . ." he said slowly. "Er . . . who could that be?" "Slow, aren't you?"
