        <p>My love for photography began in high school, where I took 3 years of dark room photography. My passion and skills continued to flourish, and I now have over 8 years of experience in Family & Children, High School Seniors, Headshots, Business Products, and photography for small events. However, I will always enjoy taking the camera out to capture New Mexico's beautiful landscapes and sunsets the most.</p>

            <p>He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of the egg's song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him. "I've got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground. . . ." he said slowly. "Er . . . who could that be?" "Slow, aren't you?" He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him. "Well, thats what Diggory thought," she said. "He lay there talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. ...".</p>

        <p>During the 15-week UX/UI Deep Dive Bootcamp, I learned about why behavioral analysis is so important in UX/UI design, and how to design with people in mind. We did this by discovering research methodologies, discussing design in everyday objects, as well as learning about basics of color theory, layout design, and typography. As the "Mantiflora Desert Co-Op" my partner, Ryan Corlett, and I used what we learned to develop a function game demo called Desert Quinn.</p>
        <p>Desert Quinn is a casual, exploration resource management game that has players navigating a vast, colorful Southwestern environment. We began our journey with UX research to collect data about game design and development in order to answer our design question. We used software such as Figma and Miro in the planning and prototyping stages and developed the game in GamerMaker Studio. I lead game development and programming in GameMaker Studio, where I wrote and created various functions and controls of sprites, sounds and prompts, that brought the game to life. You can learn more about Desert Quinn <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P27C1RQYcjUuiiL0NQr9W-CANiCecUM1Ml0HJTEsL5A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" role="button">here</a>.</p>
