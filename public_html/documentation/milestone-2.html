    <p><b>Content Strategy: </b> I would like to have navbar that is stuck to the top. In the navbar will be links that will jump to the different sections on the page. I would like to incorporate a logo and some text in the navbar as well. The logo and text will not be clickable, if this is not possible I would like to incorporate the logo and text into a small section at the top of the site, shown in the browser wireframe.</p>
    <p>The photography, graphic design, and UX/UI design sections will have a large image with a collage of the work I have done in each subject. Next to those images I will have a small paragraph explaining the type of work I do and how long I have been doing each subject. (Later on when I develop this site more I would like to make each section its own page, with a very minimal home page and three images that direct the user to the seperate section's pages)</p>
    <p>Finally, the last section would be an "About Erin" section where I would have a small paragraph about me, my experience and where I work from. Below this will be a "contact me" area where there will be links in either icons with text, or text-only links to email me, review my resume pdf, redirect the user to my LinkedIn profile, or lastly redirect the user to my Instagram account.</p>
